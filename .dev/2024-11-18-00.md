So the `QuiverContext` type should probably be unbundled. There's a few different situations that require slightly different types:

- as the context is being built up
- as the first middleware is being called
- whenever exit, return, error, or throw have been called
- probably some others

What is the correct way to represent the types:

- needs nothing
- satisifies nothing

Thinking through the above. I'd really like to put together a concise description of why, for example, `Record<string, any>` doesn't work. To me the english statement "i don't depend on any keys to be available" is more clearly represented by "undefined" than `Record<string, any>`.

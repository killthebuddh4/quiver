I'm thinking about the XMTP initialization API and how it interacts with the Quiver API. I think the three big questions are:

1. How should options flow up and down the layers (XTMP <-> Quiver)?
2. How should errors be handled?
3. How should startup be handled? On the one hand we can't make it completely transparent because in the browser startup requires user interaction, but on the other hand we want to be able to ignore startup in the common case.

For now we basically hide the XMTP layer from the user beyond passing it to `quiver(xmtp)`. I think this is basically what we want, and we should be able to kind of assume that XMTP just works in the same way that HTTP just works, but we also need some escape hatches.

NOTE we need to handle middleware errors in the createHandler function.

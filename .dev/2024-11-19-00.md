Ok I added in `undefined` as the base case for the input and output contexts. I added some new tests and also a bunch of placeholder tests that I'll fill in as I go (there's 200+). I added a `router.middleware` function to the router which breaks typesafety but I'm ok with that for now. I may choose to throw whenever `router.middleware` is called after `router.router` or `router.function`.

Braindump of possible next steps:

- work on router.middleware type safety
- think through q.serve
- think through the startup/teardown api
- fill out some tests
- test q.client
- add some more robustness in a number of different places
- DOCUMENTATION

But I think I'm going to do documentation and then move onto building something with it!!!

Ok so the core v0 API is done, tested, documented, and shared with a few people. Now I'm working on a small peer-to-peer tic-tac-toe example that's a more concrete example of what you can do. As I build the example I'm working through bugs or quality of life improvements in the core library. Also, I'm learning about and thinking about how `quiver` can be used with React. Right now it's actually kind of hard.

One issue I've found is with creating and serving a router. You have to bind functions to the router, but if those functions are stateful then it won't work because they're bound to earlier versions of the router. I just ran into the problem right now and I haven't figured out whether this is a fundamental problem, or it's just something requiring a bit of boilerplate, or maybe I'm just holding it (React) wrong. Sometimes it takes a few days or weeks to reload React's programming environment in my brain after I've been working in other environments.

ASIDE:

One thing that would be a cool demo is something like a zustand store that's shared between N clients.

So the hard part of the middleware system is thought out, implemented, documented (the basics), and even tested! The next thing I'm doing is routing, but I think routing is going to be pretty easy given (1) v0 is already done and working and (2) the middleware system is nice and clean.

I think the router in and of itself is going to be very quick, but then there's going to be one slightly tricky part afterwards: How do we handle binding? Router's have to be bound (1) at the root to an XMTP instance and (2) at the leaves to functions. It's not hard to implement naively but gets tricky when you start considering certain API ergonomic concerns. So there's this open and ongoing question about what components we want to use and combine. We have

- Function
- Middleware
- Router
- Provider
- App
- Server
- Client

and I'm not certain which ones we want to keep and which we want to forego. Ultimately what we want is both to build it right away, like today, but also to provide a really nice API. These two goals are definitely in tension, but I think we can get something ok.

Ok so I just thought of something I don't think I'd really considered before. What if instead of middleware we just have router.

- router.extend()
- router.pipe()
- router.route()

Hmm. I'll have to think more about this.
Hmm. I'll have to think more about this.
Hmm. I'll have to think more about this.

- router.function(handler) ???

Hmm.....

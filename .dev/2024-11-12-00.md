I spent a half-day refamiliarizing myself with the code because it's been a couple months since I wrote it. It held up pretty well but the types are inherently tricky. After some weeks of intense development and then some weeks of not touching it, I have a pretty clear idea of what exactly I want to do next.

- write down basic rules for `mw.extend`, `mw.pipe`, and `mw.exec`
- write tests for the basic rules
- write a few basic end-to-end tests
- pin down a working v0.0.1 that I will use for my own use case #1
- implement use case #1
- make minor changes to the API as needed for use case #1
- update documentation
- share use case #1 and this library
